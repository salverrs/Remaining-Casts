# Remaining Casts

This plugin shows the remaining number of casts for spells.

- The remaining casts can be displayed on the menu tooltip, spell tooltip and as individual infoboxes.
- Spells can be whitelisted, blacklisted and pinned by name.
- Chat warnings can be configured at predefined cast amounts.

All features can be enabled/disabled and configured further through the plugin settings.

### Notes

- Doesn't currently support powered staves.
- Bryophyta's staff is semi-supported, it's assumed to provide infinite nature runes but charges are not tracked.
- Required levels are shortened on spell tooltips to conserve space e.g. Level 15 -> [15].
